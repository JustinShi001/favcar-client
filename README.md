## What the app does
It's a favorite car web app that allows users to create, view and update their favorite cars.
It also allows users to make an appointment with an existing dealer in the system.

## How it works
The app is built using a html/css handle bar front end and rails-api backend.

## Technologies used
- Javascript - project logic
- jQuery - DOM event handling
- AJAX - interaction with backend API/database
- handlebars - for displaying user responses in a more organzied format
